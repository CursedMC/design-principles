# One Block At A Time
One of the main aspects of Minecraft is breaking and placing blocks. To break this experience would fundamentally change how the game feels.<br><br>
For instance, if we added a bore drill that could mine 3x3 tunnels, complicated redstone bore drills would become obsolete.
When you change a critical game mechanic that way, you change the way people play the game and the progression of the game. Usually, it makes the
game less fun or repetitive.
