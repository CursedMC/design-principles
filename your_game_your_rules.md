# Your Game, Your Rules
Minecraft is a sandbox game. It allows you to manipulate the environment to your desire.<br><br>

This is very important. There's a reason why Minecraft doesn't have official lore, quests, or even remotely linear game progression. In Minecraft, you write the story. You, the player, make the rules. If we were to add a quest book with a list of missons to complete into Minecraft, the experience would no longer be about you.
